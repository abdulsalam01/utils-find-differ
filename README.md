# utils-find-differ
Python utility to find difference between 2 datasets by lookup to spesific column

## Motivation
It's hard to find tools or function that can see differentiate between 2datasest simply and fast, so I come with the simplest things and fast to find distinguish things over 2 datasest

## Tools
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Numpy

## Version
v1: It's first version of finding different data by specific column, in the near future let's make it better with support complex things
